# static-site

static-site was written because hugo had too steep a learning curve. It reads all the files from
`--in`, runs them through Go's `templates/html` parser, and writes them to `--out`. For advanced
usage like json parsing, read the source code `main.go` it is much shorter than hugo's docs.

```
